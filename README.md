# 🛡️ QuantumSafe

> The future of blockchain security begins now.

QuantumSafe is a next-gen platform designed to help users analyze and secure digital assets against quantum computing threats. We leverage advanced AI and security algorithms to scan smart contracts, wallets, NFTs, and decentralized apps (DApps) for quantum vulnerabilities.

## ⚠️ Detected Vulnerabilities

1. Shor's Algorithm Exposure (breaks RSA/ECDSA)
2. Grover's Algorithm Weaknesses (hash collision risk)
3. Lack of Post-Quantum Key Exchange
4. No Lattice or ZK-Based Cryptography
5. Weak Signature Schemes (ECDSA, RSA)
6. Non-upgradable legacy code
7. Centralized metadata exposure
8. Replayable wallet signatures
9. Predictable contract opcodes
10. No post-quantum migration strategy
